# MSFT Stock Analysis

The code in this repository is part  of a research project that aims to work with time series data. The data used in this project is the Microsoft stock data from various years. The data is available in the file `MSFT_data.csv` in the data folder. The data is in the form of a time series, where each row represents a day and some of the columns are the following:
- Open - The price of the stock when the market opened
- High - The highest price of the stock during the day
- Low - The lowest price of the stock during the day
- Close - The price of the stock when the market closed
- Volume - The number of shares traded during the day

The goal of this project is to analyze the data, preprocess it and make predictions about the future stock prices.
